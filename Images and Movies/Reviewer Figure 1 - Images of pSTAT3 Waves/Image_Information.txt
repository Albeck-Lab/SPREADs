Image is from 2021-02-11 HBE1 AE Cytokines_pSTAT3_3x3.nd2 experiment.
XY 24 (of 58)
Cells were treated with 20ng/mL IL-1b for ~24 hrs before fixing and staining for pSTAT3.
Scale bar is 250 um for the stitched fullsize image.

For reviewer figure 1D - the scale bar is 250 um.
For the zoomed in examples used in reviewer figure 1 E-G, the scale bars are 50 um.

Dapi LUTs was scaled to 0-4500 with a gamma of 1.
Cy5 (pSTAT3) was scaled to 250-1400 with a gamma of 1.25. 
This was exclusively in an attempt to minimize the shading effect of each tile that we see from stitching the image and in no way affects the finding.


For live-cell movie, same region was cropped. RFP channel luts were set to 50-4000 with a gamma of 0.5. 0.5 was to scale for heterogeneity in sensor expression for visualization and was not performed during analysis.

Cropped images are of the same XY, they are just 500 pixel x 500 pixel crops, zoomed in (scale bar is 50 um for these).

Tps for images are -1hr, 1 tp after tx, 5hrs, 10hr, 15hrs, and 20hrs after tx
